# Final Greenfoot Project

This game is Pong and it is a two player game. One player control the left paddle with the W and S keys and the other controls the right paddle with the up and down arrow keys. The more points the opposite player gets, the faster your paddle will move, helping you get more points. First to 10 points wins.

To start the game from the menu screen, you have to click the space bar.
